# Friendship Bracelet Optimizer

## Introduction

This is a program that takes letters and a list of strings and finds the best strings to form using the given letters so that as many letters as possible are used. In other words, it minimizes the leftover letters. The idea of this program was to help in building [friendship bracelets](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/07/taylor-swift-eras-tour-australia-friendship-bracelets-inspiration-beads-explained) for Taylor Swift's Eras tour. My girlfriend is a huge swiftie and wanted to use her available letters as efficiently as possible. This repository contains both a (slow) recursive dynamic programming solution and a (fast) integer linear programming solution for the problem.

## The problem

Finding the best bracelet texts is a variation of classic [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), which is known to be NP-hard. Specifically, the problem is [0/1 multidimensional knapsack problem](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=87646)

It can be formulated as follows:

## The dynamic programming solution

The initial solution used [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) with memoization. However, the running time of this approach exploded as the amount of available letters grew. I suspect the reason for this to be the limited overlap between subproblems â€“ only a few combinations of texts lead to precisely the same letter usage. Adding the memoization to the recursive function actually increased the running time (likely due to the the overhead of storing the letter states). On my machine the running time of the dynamic programming solution with a data set of 61 available letters and 305 bracelet text options is about 1 minute and 15 seconds without and 2 minutes with memoization. With the real letter counts (total of 283 letters) the program did not finish execution in 5 hours.

## The integer linear programming solution

This more efficient method leverages [integer linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) with the help of the python library [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) that calls [CBC solver](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc). The running time with real letter counts was just a few seconds.
